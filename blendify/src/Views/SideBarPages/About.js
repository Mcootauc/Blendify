    { title: "What is Blendify?", description: `Blendify is a web application for DJs of any level that aims to simplify the time-consuming process of searching for 
    songs to mix by automatically recommending songs that match an inputted song based on its BPM. Our application also allows for users to get song recommendations 
    based on their own music library. Currently, DJs both professional and amateurs often spend a significant amount of time and effort manually searching for songs 
    that are a good match in terms of BPM (beats per minute) when they are looking to create a seamless mix of songs. This process is often done through trial and 
    error, and involves the use of multiple software and platforms, making it cumbersome and time-consuming. Blendify aims to simplify and expedite this process by 
    automatically recommending songs that are a good match in terms of BPM and key, based on an inputted current song or artist. The app will use data from the userâ€™s 
    own music library as well as suggest new songs, making the process of song selection quicker, easier, and more efficient for DJs of all levels. Blendify caters 
    towards amateur, intermediate, and professional DJs as they can expedite their music search mid-set, or prior to the set. Blendify is also for regularmusic 
    listeners looking to expand their library based on specific criteria.`, backgroundImage: "url-to-background-1.jpg" },
